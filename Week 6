Prompting with a purpose
- Need to be specific= who its writing for, why it matters, and what tone to use 
- Data inspires creativity: Every trend or competitor move can become a story brief.
- Good prompts include the “why”: Context creates strategy.
- Strong outputs sound human: They connect insights to emotion, exactly what Wayfair’s audience values.

Which System message generated content you could imagine Wayfair actually publishing and why? 
  The Product Storyteller + Feature-Focused Messaging system message generates content most like what Wayfair would publish because it highlights specific product features (material, size, durability) and ties them to clear customer benefits in warm, lifestyle-driven language. This mirrors Wayfair’s real marketing style, which focuses on practical, aspirational home styling and product value rather than technical trend analysis.

What single phrase or instruction inside your System Message most changed the tone or focus? 
  This phrase directly shifted the output from analytical or generic to story-driven, feature-focused, and lifestyle-oriented, matching the tone and focus of Wayfair-style marketing.

How to Edit Like a Content Writer
Use this quick checklist when refining your AI outputs:
- Simplify every sentence.
- Replace generic adjectives (“beautiful”, “amazing”) with specifics (“woven”, “hand-finished”, “textured”).
- Add sensory cues: what something feels or looks like.
- End with warmth or action: something that feels human (“Find yours. Feel the difference.”).

Brand editing is creative control. It’s how your ideas become recognizably Wayfair.
Clarity beats cleverness. Wayfair’s best content is honest, confident, and warm.
Emotion is the differentiator. Always find the human in the data.
