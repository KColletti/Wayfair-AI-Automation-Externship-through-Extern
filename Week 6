Prompting with a purpose

- Data inspires creativity: Every trend or competitor move can become a story brief.
- Good prompts include the “why”: Context creates strategy.
- Strong outputs sound human: They connect insights to emotion, exactly what Wayfair’s audience values.

Which System message generated content you could imagine Wayfair actually publishing and why? 
  The Product Storyteller + Feature-Focused Messaging system message generates content most like what Wayfair would publish because it highlights specific product features (material, size, durability) and ties them to clear customer benefits in warm, lifestyle-driven language. This mirrors Wayfair’s real marketing style, which focuses on practical, aspirational home styling and product value rather than technical trend analysis.

  This phrase directly shifted the output from analytical or generic to story-driven, feature-focused, and lifestyle-oriented, matching the tone and focus of Wayfair-style marketing.
