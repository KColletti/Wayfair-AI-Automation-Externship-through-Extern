This Week I will be Laying the Groudwork for Competitive Strategy
In the Week 2 and 3 my agent learned how to detect emerging consumer trends, these next two weeks my agent will see what competiters, such as tracking product updates, pricing changes, and feature trends from retailers like Amazon and Walmart.

competitive monitoring comes in: the process of tracking rival products, prices, features, campaigns, and reviews to guide smarter decisions.
  - Matched products by attributes, not just SKUs / Automated price intelligence / Tracked trends by category / Delivered measurable impact

Analyze one competing retailer in category of rugs: will closley look at their product listings, prices, styles, and messaging to spot patterns, gaps, and opportunities

If your agent surfaced these five signals automatically next week, which one Wayfair decision would you recommend to act on immediately (merch, marketing, or product)? Explain in one sentence why.: Act on the handloom/woven accent rug trend immediately through merchandising, since adding or featuring these versatile small rugs aligns with current consumer demand and can drive quick sales.
