This weeek I will build my first Consumer Trend Discovery AI Agent 
  - it listens to user queries, interprets, and decides to scrape data or respond dircelty. 
  - directly supports decision making in areas of: pricing, product imagrey, customer reviews 
    - helps Wayfair stay ahead of shifting design and shopping trneds 

Goal: 
- Teach agent to understand queries: build an intent identifier that knows when to answer a question or start trend discovery 
- Collect data from real sources: scrape trending products from Amazon, Walmart, and capture live trend signals from blogs and search. 
- Merge insights into a trend report: combine everything your agent finds into one clean, auto generated trend summary 

I pulled the official n8nio/n8n image from Docker Hub using Docker Desktop, which downloaded the image locally and made it available under the images tab. 

Now agent will comprehend and look for: 
  keywords: words such as trending, popular, teop-selling, new collection 
  conext signals: links to amazon or walmart product pages 
  request tone: exploratory language ("show me", "find out") vs. factual ("what is") - learns to classify what type of request its handling 

Using JSON it keeps everything structured and precise (no rambling, or guessing- just clear communication) 
  with intent detection: it gives AI agent the ability to think before it works (automated -> intelligent) 

Workflow: 
-Trigger= chat message, input has been entered 
- Ai agent= find intent of user, so for a data analysis is true just something random output is false 
  Parse to be JSON format- classifier returns its JSON wrapped markdown- the code removes these markdowns. It then tries to turn the cleaned text into a real data object that workflow can read. If parsing fails, will return {"trend": "no", answer: "Parsing error"} to avoid crashig downstream logic. When it runs smoothly will return {"trend": "yes"} 
  So the User Intent Identifier returns yes if the user asks about rug trends and returns no for a simple question and provides a respose wihout scraping. 
- if statement: if yes, go to scrapper to find trend, if no then send message 

The detecting intent it will filter out any meaningless prompts, ensuring only prompts looking for data trends/ analysis get fulfilled.

Give Agent a Voice when handling non-trend Queries 
  Agent replies to the user with a question so it has a clear answer too be efficent 
-If node- false= pases control to simple AI Agent 
  There is a Basic LLM Chain Node that the flow goes to which takes the exact message the user typed int the chat input node and feed it into the language model (gemini) to send back a simple, relevant reply -> gemini chat model attatched reads the users messgae and generates a natural reply (getting this reply for a non trend query, proves it is not sent for scrapping)

Capturing Industry Signals through RSS Feeds
-Chat sent is a correct query-> RSS feeds provides: clean, machine-readable updates from trusted sources (design blogs, reatiler sites, and brand press releases) 
  RSS brings all content to you- RSS (Really simple syndication) 
    resons to use- privacy, slow at typing, slow internet 
  Need RSS reader to use- feedly, old reader, feedreader, feed demon, inoreader, rss owl, newsblur, diggreader (3 most popular feedly, old reader, inoreader)-> * AI agent doesnt visit the webist, but reads the structured entries and knowns what and when it is published and where to find it * now anytime website resleases new info user gets notified 
    - allows each feed to be in real-time, allowing AI connect product data (amazon/ walmart) with contextual signals (from media) to detect emerging trends early 
    - RSS remain open, structured and transparent (internet original piblic API) 
-Finding relibale rug trends- these feeds will be running the engine (4 high-quality sources that regulary post about rug or interior design trends, feature buyer or retailer insights (new and selling), include a working RSS feed link)

True node- is triggered when a trend-related question is detected 
  -4 RSS, use merge to connect all 4 to allow the incoming RSS feeds into one list, so agent has a single, unified feed to work with instead of jugglling mulitple separte sources 
    - split= since every RSS feed has different formatting, this helps summarize them by extracting just the important parts- post title, URL, date and summary, so agent can read consistently 
      -javascript code filters out old posts and keeps only recent updates from last 7 days

Adding Google Search for lve Web Trends 
  -Will allow agent to have access to the live web, to fetch the latest updates, blog posts, or product trends as they happen 
    - If node is true-> detects trend intent and activates the google search node, passes the original user query downstram for live search 
      -Google search node: fetched up to date web content from google using a custom search api. It sends a search request with the users messgae as teh query and retrieves structured results (titles, links and snippets)
