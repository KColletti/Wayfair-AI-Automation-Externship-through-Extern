Merging Trend, Competitor and Insight Piplines

Supabase gives the agent memory (store, recall and build upon) 
- Memory makes intelligence useful: An agent without storage forgets, Supabase turns your workflow into a living system that remembers.
- Data is now durable: Every output from your agents: trends, benchmarks, ideas can now persist, be tracked, and compared over time.
- You’ve built the foundation: Supabase is the first step toward an always-on AI system that learns continuously.

Now that your agents are storing outputs in one shared database what does this unlock for Wayfair and how might having this intelligence in one place change the way real teams make decisions?
-It changes team decision-making from disconnected, team-by-team inputs to faster, more aligned choices driven by shared, accumulated intelligence.
