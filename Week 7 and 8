Merging Trend, Competitor and Insight Piplines

Supabase gives the agent memory (store, recall and build upon) 
- Memory makes intelligence useful: An agent without storage forgets, Supabase turns your workflow into a living system that remembers.
- Data is now durable: Every output from your agents: trends, benchmarks, ideas can now persist, be tracked, and compared over time.
- You’ve built the foundation: Supabase is the first step toward an always-on AI system that learns continuously.

Now that your agents are storing outputs in one shared database what does this unlock for Wayfair and how might having this intelligence in one place change the way real teams make decisions?
-It changes team decision-making from disconnected, team-by-team inputs to faster, more aligned choices driven by shared, accumulated intelligence.

1_TrendSignals — Market Momentum
Tracks product and aesthetic shifts across categories.
Key Columns: Trend, Category, Detected Date, Material, Pattern, Key Insight.
Each row shows a pattern emerging in the market — colors, textures, or materials gaining traction.
These are signals for Wayfair’s merchandising teams to identify growth areas.
Example: Multiple mentions of “washable” and “distressed” across sources → strong demand trend worth inventory focus.

2_CompetitorMoves — Competitive Landscape
Captures what Amazon or other competitors are emphasizing.
Key Columns: Competitor, Product / Collection, Price, Rating, Wayfair Gap, Suggested Action.
Each row is effectively a competitive insight card — what rivals are doing and what Wayfair should do next.
Example: If Amazon highlights “soft & durable” in product copy → Wayfair can mirror that in PDP descriptions.

3_Allinsights — Creative Intelligence
Connects market and competitor signals into actionable ideas.
Key Columns: Insight, Summary Insight, Recommended Action, Content Idea, Type, Impact Level.
This is where strategic intelligence becomes creative direction — what to feature in campaigns, blogs, and social.
Think of it as Wayfair’s internal brief generator for marketing teams.

4_ExecutiveSummary — The Big Picture
Automatically aggregates data from the other three tabs.
Shows summaries, counts, and trend distributions.
Uses built-in formulas (=COUNTIF(), =AVERAGE(), =UNIQUE()) to calculate insights dynamically.
You never write to this sheet — it’s designed to listen and display.
This is your “decision dashboard” — one glance tells leadership what’s happening across the ecosystem.

Data means nothing until it’s readable: A dashboard’s real value is in how clearly it communicates. Every formula, color, and layout choice exists to make someone’s decision easier.
Automation without interpretation is noise: You’ve automated the pipeline, but intelligence emerges only when you slow down to understand patterns: what’s shifting, who’s winning, and why it matters.
Good dashboards report and they persuade: Every highlight, every conditional format is a subtle argument: this is what deserves your attention. You’re shaping focus and then helping make decisions.

Trend Discovery Agent -Detects emerging product patterns — colors, materials, sizes
1_TrendSignals
Competitor Monitoring Agent-Tracks competitor launches and pricing gaps
2_CompetitorMoves
Content Insight Agent- Converts trends and competitor data into campaign ideas
3_Allinsights
Executive Summary- Synthesizes all three into one decision-ready view
4_ExecutiveSummary

-When the three data streams aligned, it made clear that intelligence emerges when multiple signals validate one another and strengthen confidence. That alignment transformed separate data points into a clear, decision-ready insight instead of isolated information.

Reflection: 
This project showed me that ideas only turn into real systems when the order and connections between steps are carefully thought out. Every part depended on the one before it, so small decisions early on had a big impact later, which made cause and effect really clear. More than the tools themselves, I learned how important it is to think about how everything works together as a whole so the system produces meaningful insight instead of random output.

I was most curious about the automation and data side of the project, especially building workflows that could run on their own and turn raw information into something useful. I liked refining the logic and seeing how data flowed from one step to the next without manual input. That says I’m interested in solving problems focused on efficiency, scalability, and using data to drive smarter decisions.

If I rebuilt this agent a year from now, I would start with a clearer system design and end goal before building individual pieces. I’d focus more on modular workflows, better data validation, and cleaner logic early on so changes and scaling would be easier later. With more experience, I’d also experiment with more advanced automation and feedback loops to make the system more adaptive and efficient overall.

Project had a highlight reel what would it be on: The highlight moment is the end-to-end automation: collecting competitive signals, validating them across sources, and surfacing prioritized insights that support faster, more confident decisions.

What skills were leveled up: I most leveled up my skills in integrating automated workflows across tools—specifically connecting AI-generated outputs to Supabase and syncing them into Google Sheets. This project strengthened my understanding of how data moves between systems, how to structure outputs for reliable ingestion, and how to maintain consistency across automated pipelines.

Harest part: The hardest part was cleaning and structuring raw HTML data from subpages. I worked through it by staying patient, troubleshooting step by step, and asking for help when I got stuck.
